# Diabetic Readmission Prediction

This project uses real-world clinical data to predict the likelihood of hospital readmission for diabetic patients. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling using Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers.

---

## Overview

Hospital readmissions can be costly and often preventable. Leveraging data from over 100,000 diabetic patient encounters, this project builds a predictive model to identify high-risk individuals before discharge. The objective is to assist healthcare providers in planning early interventions and improving patient outcomes.


## Objectives

- Predict whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted within 30 days.
- Identify key factors influencing readmission risk.
- Use machine learning to improve insights and support healthcare decision-making.

## Methodology

- Removed multicollinear and redundant features using correlation matrix and VIF.
- Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
- Handled class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Trained an `XGBoost` classifier.
- Evaluated performance using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.

---

## Results

- **Best Model**: XG Boost(after SMOTE and feature tuning)
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Precision**: 1.00
  - **Recall**: 0.87
  - **F1-score**: 0.93
  - **ROC-AUC Score**: 0.958
- **Top Predictors**:
  - `total_encounters`  
  - `age`   
  - `num_procedures`    
  - `discharge_disposition_id`
  - `is_chronic`

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of predictive modeling in healthcare to identify at-risk diabetic patients and reduce preventable readmissions. 


## Future Improvements

- Integrate temporal features such as time between admissions
- Apply model explainability using SHAP or LIME
- Validate using external datasets or time-split holdouts for generalizability
